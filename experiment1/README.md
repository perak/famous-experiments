Experiment 1
============

Iron-Router + Famo.us
---------------------

Add pages/routes as you normally do - page will be drawn by famo.us using "easeIn" transition.

"Magic" which connects iron-router with famo.us is called from `/client/layout/layout.js` when layout is rendered for the first time. Code responsible for that is in `client/famous.js`

That's it - my first famo.us experiment.
